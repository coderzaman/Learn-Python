# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my structured Python learning notes and exercises, organized into directories by topic. Each folder contains code examples, practice exercises, and concepts I have learned throughout my journey in Python. The focus is on understanding each concept deeply through practical examples.

## Directory Structure

### 01. Python Basics
- Foundational Python concepts including variables, data types, basic I/O, and operators.

### 02. List
- Learning and practicing list operations such as declaration, accessing elements, slicing, sorting, and list comprehensions.

### 03. Control Flow
- Understanding conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `elif`, and looping structures (`for` and `while` loops).

### 04. String
- Exploring string manipulation methods, slicing, and formatting in Python.

### 05. Tuples
- Working with tuples and understanding immutability, packing, and unpacking.

### 06. Sets
- Learning set operations, including union, intersection, and difference.

### 07. Dictionaries
- Dictionary operations including key-value pair management, iteration, and dictionary comprehensions.

### 08. Functions
- Defining and using functions, lambda functions, and higher-order functions in Python.

### 09. Time and Datetime
- Working with Pythonâ€™s `time` and `datetime` modules for handling date and time data.

### 10. File Input and Output
- Understanding how to read from and write to files in Python, file handling modes, and error handling.

### 11. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Practicing object-oriented programming with classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### 12. Projects
- Various mini-projects combining the concepts learned across different topics.

### 13. Python for Django
- Python code specifically related to learning Django, including models, views, URLs, and more.

## How to Use

Each directory represents a Python concept with corresponding code examples. You can navigate into any directory to explore the Python files and review the practical examples.

## Notes

All theoretical explanations and code snippets have been organized and documented using **CherryTree**, which results in a 352-page PDF when exported. This is the culmination of extensive practice and learning across different Python concepts, including real-world applications.
