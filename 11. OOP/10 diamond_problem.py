# Cause of Error
# First Call to D.__init__():
#
# When you create an instance of D, the constructor of D is called first. This is correct.
# Call to super().__init__() in D:
#
# The super() function in D tries to call the next class in the MRO (Method Resolution Order), which is B.
# Call to super().__init__() in B:
#
# Inside B.__init__(), super() is called, which normally would refer to A because B inherits from A.
# Expected Behavior:
#
# However, in the case of D(B, C), due to multiple inheritance, the next class to be called (after B) should be C, not Aâ€”because C is listed in D's inheritance declaration.
# The Problem:
#
# The real issue arises from the fact that both B and C inherit from A in some form, which causes a conflict in the inheritance chain. Python's MRO can't decide how to handle this situation consistently because C should also call B according to your setup, but B already calls A.
# The MRO Error:
#
# Python gets confused in resolving this order, and it throws an MRO inconsistency error. The conflict arises because Python can't decide whether A should be called from B first or from C. So, the MRO is ambiguous, which is why the error occurs.
