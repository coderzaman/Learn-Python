# Counting the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list can be done using the count() method.

# Syntax:
# count = my_list.count(element)

# Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
print(numbers.count(2))


# Count occurrences of 6 (which is not in the list)
count_sixes = numbers.count(6)
print(count_sixes)  # Output: 0


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits.count("apple"))
